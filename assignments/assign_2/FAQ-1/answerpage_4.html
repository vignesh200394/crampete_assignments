Sharing your Apple ID with someone else means you are giving them access to all your personal content and may lead to confusion over who actually owns the account. To share purchases, photos, a calendar, and more with someone else, try Family SharingOpens in a new window., iCloud Photo SharingOpens in a new window., or other easy-to-use sharing features.<h3></p></td>
